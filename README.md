                                  Sports Injury Analysis
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sports injury data to predict whether an athlete is likely to be injured based on various features such as workload, position, and date. The analysis is performed using a Jupyter Notebook (finalMac.ipynb), which includes data preprocessing, model implementation, training, and evaluation.

The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict injuries, helping teams and coaches make data-driven decisions to prevent injuries and optimize player performance.

1.Dataset
The dataset used in this project is stored in a CSV file named final2.csv. It contains the following columns:
•	athlete_id(footballer_id): Unique identifier for each footballer.
•	date: Date of the record.
•	postion: Position of the footballer (e.g., midfielder, attacker).
•	value: A numerical value associated with the footballer
•	game_workload: Workload of the footballer in the game.
•	injury: Indicates whether the footballer was injured (yes or No).
2.Requirements
      To run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script, you need the following libraries installed:
    •	Python 3.8+
•	pandas
•	numpy
•	scikit-learn
•	matplotlib
•	seaborn
•	xgboost
•	tensorflow (optional, for neural networks)

3.Usage
Running the Jupyter Notebook
1.	Open the Jupyter Notebook:
2.	Execute the cells in the notebook to perform data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
3.	Running the Python Script
If you have converted the notebook to a Python script (finalMac.py), you can run it directly:
